# Visualizing Static Networks with R

In our daily lives, networks play a crucial role in connecting people, places, and ideas. This project focuses on visualizing static networks of Marvel heroes using R programming, enabling learners to express complex relationships and connections in a clear and informative manner.

## Course Overview

In this course, we will cover the following learning objectives:

- Learn to preprocess raw data to create nodes and edges
- Learn to create network data using the igraph package
- Learn to visualize static networks with base R functions

By the end of this course, you will have the skills to effectively visualize static networks with R.

## Project Tasks

The hands-on project on Visualizing Static Networks with R is divided into the following tasks:

1. Explain What a Network Is and Import Libraries
2. Read Raw Data and Calculate the Amount of Collaboration Among Marvel Heroes
3. Select a Weight Criterion Using a Histogram and Use the Criterion to Extract Edges From the Data Produced in Task 2
4. Text Processing, and Extract Nodes From the Edges Data Produced in Task 3
5. Create a Network Based on the Edges and Nodes Components Created in Task 4 and Calculate Its Communities
6. Assign Community Information to Edges and Nodes Data and Then Visualize a Network
7. Visualize Different Types of Static Networks
