# Visualizing-static-networks-with-R
In daily life, our connections with family and friends form our social networks. Across the country, roads between different places form transportation networks. In research areas, collaborations among different researchers form research collaboration networks. Visible or invisible, networks exist in many aspects of our life. Being able to visualize networks will help us understand relationships embedded in complicated network information. Static networks can be easily used in reports and presentations. In this project, learners will plot various types of static networks of marvel heroes using R programming. A good handle of this method will help learners quickly express informative relationships and connections among different variables.

In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:

   Learn to preprocess raw data to create nodes and edges

   Learn to create network data using the igraph package

   Learn to visualize static networks with base R functions

By the end of this course, you will be able to visualize static networks with R.

The hand- on project on Visualizing Static Networks with R is divided into the following tasks:

Task 1: Explain What a Network Is and Import Libraries

Task 2: Read Raw Data and Calculate the Amount of Collaboration Among Marvel Heroes

Task 3: Select a Weight Criterion Using a Histogram and Use the Criterion to Extract Edges From the Data Produced in Task 2

Task 4: Text Processing, and Extract Nodes From the Edges Data Produced in Task 3 

Task 5: Create a Network Based on the Edges and Nodes Components Created in Task 4 and Calculate Its Communities

Task 6: Assign Community Information to Edges and Nodes Data and Then Visualize a Network

Task 7: Visualize Different Types of Static Networks
